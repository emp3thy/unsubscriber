# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Last Updated:** October 13, 2025

Unsubscriber ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our software.

---

## 1. No Data Collection or Transmission

Unsubscriber is a standalone Python client application that runs entirely on your local computer. We do not collect, transmit, store, or sell any user data.

**Specifically:**
- No user data is ever sent to remote servers.
- We do not collect personal information, usage data, or email content.
- We do not track you or monitor your activity.
- We do not share or sell any information to third parties.

---

## 2. Local-Only Operation

All functionality of Unsubscriber is performed directly on your device:
- All data is processed locally.
- The application does not connect to any server controlled by us.
- Any access to your email account (e.g., through Google APIs) happens locally and only to perform actions you initiate (such as unsubscribing from mailing lists).

---

## 3. Local Logging for Debugging

To support troubleshooting and improve reliability, Unsubscriber may write logs to your local machine. These logs:
- Are only stored locally on your device.
- Do not contain private or sensitive data (e.g., email content or credentials).
- Are never transmitted to us or any third party.
- Are fully under your control — you can view, delete, or disable logging at any time.

We have no ability to access your local logs or any other data on your system.

---

## 4. Google API Use (if applicable)

If you use Unsubscriber with a Gmail account, the application may access your inbox via Google APIs. In such cases:
- We follow the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.
- All access is scoped to the minimum required and used only for the unsubscribe functionality.
- No data is stored or transmitted externally.
- You can revoke access at any time via your Google account settings.

## 5. Privacy by Design

We built Unsubscriber with privacy and user control as core principles:
- No cloud backend or server-side data storage
- No account registration or login required
- No telemetry, analytics, or tracking
- No data ever leaves your device

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the application or legal requirements. If any changes affect how your data is handled, we will update this document and notify users where appropriate.
