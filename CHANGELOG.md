## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-04

### Added
- **Complete email management system** with inbox scanning, unsubscribe automation, and manual deletion
- **Multi-strategy unsubscribe system** supporting RFC 2369 headers and direct HTTP links
- **Smart scoring algorithm** that prioritizes senders based on email frequency, read status, and unsubscribe availability
- **Whitelist protection** for important senders and domains
- **Cross-platform GUI** built with Tkinter for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Secure credential management** with encrypted password storage
- **Comprehensive logging** for troubleshooting and audit trails
- **Progress tracking** with visual indicators during long operations
- **Error recovery** with graceful handling of network issues and server errors
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse and respect server limits

### Database
- **SQLite database** with optimized schema for email accounts, whitelist, unwanted senders, and action history
- **Automatic database initialization** and migration support
- **Thread-safe database operations** with proper connection management

### Email Providers
- **Gmail support** with app password authentication and IMAP access
- **Outlook/Hotmail support** with regular password authentication
- **Automatic provider detection** from email domain
- **IMAP SSL/TLS encryption** for secure connections

### User Interface
- **Tabbed interface** for different operations (Senders, Must Delete, Whitelist)
- **Sortable tables** with color-coded priority indicators
- **Context menus** for quick actions (right-click to whitelist)
- **Progress dialogs** for long-running operations
- **Status bar** showing current operation status
- **Help system** with about dialog and app password setup instructions

### Unsubscribe Strategies
- **List-Unsubscribe Header Strategy** - Uses RFC 2369 standard headers (most reliable)
- **HTTP Strategy** - Follows unsubscribe links found in email bodies
- **Enhanced error handling** with retry logic and exponential backoff
- **Rate limiting** to prevent server overload
- **Success verification** through response analysis

### Security
- **Encrypted credential storage** using Fernet symmetric encryption
- **No plaintext passwords** stored or transmitted
- **Read-only email access** by default (no modifications without confirmation)
- **Local data storage only** (no cloud transmission)
- **App password recommendations** for enhanced security

### Performance
- **Batch processing** of emails (500 at a time) for large inboxes
- **Background threading** for UI responsiveness during long operations
- **Memory-efficient processing** with proper resource cleanup
- **Progress reporting** every 50 emails during scans

### Error Handling
- **User-friendly error messages** with actionable guidance
- **Technical error logging** for debugging while hiding details from users
- **Connection error categorization** (authentication, network, server errors)
- **Graceful degradation** when services are unavailable
- **Retry mechanisms** for transient failures

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive README** with installation, setup, and usage instructions
- **Troubleshooting guide** for common issues
- **App password setup instructions** for Gmail and Outlook
- **Privacy and security information**
- **Build instructions** for creating standalone executables

### Build System
- **PyInstaller configuration** for Windows standalone executable
- **Automated build scripts** (build.bat for Windows, build.py for cross-platform)
- **Dependency bundling** for easy distribution
- **One-file executable** (~50-80MB) that runs without Python installation

### Testing
- **Manual testing procedures** for all major features
- **Integration testing** across all components
- **Error scenario testing** for robust error handling
- **Performance testing** with large email datasets
- **Cross-platform compatibility** verification

### Technical Stack
- **Python 3.8+** with type hints throughout
- **Tkinter** for cross-platform GUI
- **SQLite3** for local data storage
- **IMAPLib** for email server communication
- **Requests** for HTTP unsubscribe operations
- **BeautifulSoup4** for HTML parsing
- **Cryptography** for secure credential storage
- **PyInstaller** for executable packaging

### Known Limitations
- **Browser-based unsubscribe pages** not supported (requires manual intervention)
- **JavaScript-heavy unsubscribe flows** may not work with HTTP strategy
- **CAPTCHA-protected pages** require manual completion
- **Multi-step unsubscribe processes** may need manual intervention

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Browser automation strategies for complex unsubscribe flows
- OAuth2 authentication for modern email providers
- Scheduled/automated scanning capabilities
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Multi-account management
- Cloud synchronization for settings

## Development Notes

This application was developed following a structured build plan with 9 phases:

1. **Foundation & Database** - Project setup, database schema, logging
2. **Email Client & Credentials** - IMAP connections, credential encryption
3. **Scoring & Grouping** - Email analysis and sender prioritization
4. **User Interface** - Tkinter GUI with tables and dialogs
5. **Unsubscribe Strategies** - Multiple approaches for unsubscribing
6. **Email Deletion** - Manual cleanup for failed unsubscribes
7. **Whitelist & Settings** - Protection and configuration management
8. **Enhanced Strategies** - Improved reliability and analytics
9. **Polish & Distribution** - Error handling, documentation, and packaging

Each phase included comprehensive acceptance criteria, testing procedures, and confidence scoring to ensure quality and reliability.
